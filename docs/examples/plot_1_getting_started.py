"""
Get started with some basics
============================

Reading videos into NumPy arrays was never more simple. This library provides 
an entire range of additional functionalities such as custom frame selection, 
frame resizing, pixel normalization, grayscale conversion and much more.

# How to simply read a video, given its path?
# -------------------------------------------

# Import
from mydia import Videos

# Initialize video path
video_path = r"./sample_video/bigbuckbunny.mp4"

# Create a reader object
reader = Videos()

# Call the 'read()' function to get the video tensor
video = reader.read(video_path)

# a tensor of shape (1, 132, 720, 1080, 3)
print("The shape of the tensor:", video.shape)

##############################################################################
# The tensor represents **1 video** having **132 frames**, with each frame
# having a width and height of 1080 and 720 pixels respectively. “**3**”
# denotes the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) channels of the video.
#
#
# Or, read multiple videos
# ------------------------
#
# .. code:: python
#
#  from mydia import Videos
#  video_paths = ["", "", ...] # list of path of videos
#  reader = Videos()
#  video = reader.read(video_paths)
#
# *For detailed information of the output tensor, view the code documentation.*
#
#
# Saving the loaded video tensor
# ------------------------------
#
# .. important:: Once the videos have been processed, they could be saved
#  as :obj:`numpy.ndarray` (in .npz or .npy format). For further details, view
#  the documentation of:
#
#  - :obj:`numpy.save`: for saving in .npy format
#
#  - :obj:`numpy.savez`: for saving in .npz format
#
#  - :obj:`numpy.load`: for loading back the saved numpy tensors
#
#  Since the whole reading process is time consuming, this could turn out to be
#  a useful way to store and reload the video tensors.
